## Introduction

Did you know that Terpene Synthases (TPSs) are responsible for the most natural scents human have ever experienced? [[1]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21114471/)

Welcome to the GitHub repository showcasing state-of-the-art methods for Terpene Synthase (TPS) discovery and characterization. 


TPSs generate the scaffolds of the largest class of natural products (more than 96.000 compounds), including several first-line medicines [[2]](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00296?casa_token=OzB4p1Y4nLoAAAAA:h85bm9CC10o33CQCMnhF1Th63mVD23YnnOGau7qhTjVhR7233XPV2-GS0LBDbIeQg-_LqjCS7ciCi7g). 
Our research, outlined in **[our accompanying paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.29.577750)**, addresses the challenge of accurately detecting TPS function using computational methods.

Our approach significantly outperforms existing methods for TPS detection and substrate prediction. Using it, we identified and experimentally confirmed activity of seven previously unknown TPS enzymes undetected by state-of-the-art protein signatures. 

Notably, our method revealed the first functional terpene cyclization in the archaeal kingdom, one of the major domains of life [[3]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro.2017.133).
Before our work, it was believed that Archaea can form prenyl monomers but cannot perform terpene cyclisation [[4]](https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/47/2/fuad008/7081307). Exactly thanks to the cyclisation, terpenoids are the largest and most diverse class of natural products. Our predictive pipeline shed light on the ancient history of TPS biosynthesis which "is deeply intertwined with the establishment of biochemistry in its present form" [[4]](https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/47/2/fuad008/7081307).

Furthermore, our research unveiled a new TPS structural domain and identified distinct subtypes of known domains, enhancing our understanding of TPS diversity and function.

This repository provides access to the source codes of our approach. We invite researchers to explore and contribute, advancing the field of enzymatic research through computational approaches.
